# Inception
# ü§î Description

This project consists in having you set up a small infrastructure composed of different
services under specific rules. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine. You
have to use docker-compose.

## Mandatory part

Each Docker image must have the same name as its corresponding service.
Each service has to run in a dedicated container:
  You then have to set up:
  - A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
  - A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and configured) only without nginx.
  - A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.
  - A volume that contains your WordPress database.
  - A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
  - A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
  - Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.

Here is an example diagram of the expected result:

  - `make build` to build all images in docker-compose

  - `make up` to start all containers in docker-compose

  - `make logs` to see the logs of the containers

  - `make stop` to stop all containers in the docker-compose

  - `make start` to start all containers in the docker-compose

  - `make down` to remove all containers in the docker-compose

  - `make reload` to remove, build and run all containers in docker-compose
